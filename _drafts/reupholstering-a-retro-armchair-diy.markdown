During December of 2017, my girlfriend and I, moved into a new house. New houses tend to be a bit on the boring side, white walls, white stained wooden floor and all. To counteract this without having to pick up a paint brush, we decided to try and keep all the furniture fairly colorful. The first thing we bought for the living room was a blue couch. We then wanted a simple armchair of sorts to complement the couch. Not long after, the chair had to be yellow and have velour chair cushions. And, used furniture are pretty popular nowadays. So yep, a simple retro yellow armchair. How hard can that be to find...

Turns out, pretty hard. Crisp yellow velour fabric on retro armchairs are not that common, actually. The idea of doing some DIY upholstery had been brewing in my mind for some time, and this seemed to be the perfect opportunity.

In all the project took around a week. Most evenings on work days and the weekend were spent working on the chair.<br />

These are the specific items bought for this project. All materials were bought at *Stoff og Stil*, a sewing supply store in Norway. In addition to the items listed above, the project required some basic tools. A round nose plier, side-cutting plier, hammer, scissors and a screwdriver. I also used some wood glue and a wood cleaner/wax remover product.

## Finding a suitable chair
We looked around online and in different used furniture stores. We found a chair at *NMS Gjenbruk* for around 700 NOK. Not that cheap, but it looked exactly like what we wanted. A simple Scandinavian style armchair. It did not have any upholstered fabric on the armrests, only the chair pad and back, which is good when you've never done anything fabric related before. The chair pad and back is challenge enough. So, go for something simple, if you want to attempt a similar project.

<br />

## Buying supplies and fabric
This step turned out to be hard to do in one go, even though I tried. I had to go back a couple of times for things I suddenly realized that I needed.

## Dismantling chair
If you plan to do a similar project, remember this: **Take a lot of photos while dismantling the chair.** As you can see from the pictures below, be meticulous in recording how the original upholstery work was done, in order for you to replicate it at a later point. It will also serve as a way to determine the order of how the new fabric pieces should be attached. For instance, the chair pad fabric should be attached after the back support fabric.

![Knocking bolts out](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/knocking-out-bolts.jpg)
The chair is pretty old, which meant that the bolts holding the chair and the base together were hard to get out. I had to apply some force to a hex key positioned at the tip of the bolt, to get them out. Once out, I cleaned the brass bolts and fasteners in a water salt and vinegar solution. Later, I applied some grease on the bolts and fasteners.

![Product label](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/product-mark.jpg)
Found this underneath the chair. Product number 2383 and made by P.I Langlo factories. Nothing about what year it was produced, which I am a bit curious about.

## Remove the original upholstery
Again, take a lot of pictures! In addition, remove the old fabric without destroying it, because you can **use the original fabric as a template when cutting the new fabric later**.

![Old fabric](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/old-fabric.jpg)
![Removing back fabric](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/removing-back-fabric.jpg)
A plate that had a cardboard feeling to it was found underneath the fabric on the back. I managed to reuse it by carefully removing all the staples that attached it to the wood frame.

![Removing staples](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/removing-staples.jpg)
A lot of staples.. Some of the staples were quite hard to get out. In order to get them out, I first split the staple in two with side-cutting pliers, and dragged each part out with the round nose plier.

![Taking off back plate](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/back-plate-off.jpg)
After having removed the cardboard covering, the interior could finally be seen. As you can see from the picture above, the buttons on the back support are secured by string and pieces of electrical wire. Which made me wonder if someone had reupholstered this chair before, maybe.

![All staples removed from underside](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/all-staples-underside-out.jpg)
Uh oh! Another layer of fabric, which meant even more staples to pull out. This was also the point, where I realized I needed a layer of cotton batting, underneath the yellow velour fabric.

Shows how the fabric from the back support and chair pad is attached to the wood frame.

![A lot of staples](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/a-lot-of-staples.jpg)
First layer removed. Another layer to go! My hands were getting sore at this point, from pulling out so many staples.

![Lost brick domino](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/lost-brick-domino.jpg)
that's where all the missing domino pieces go! Found it inside the frame of the armchair.

![Stripped armchair](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/stripped-armchair.jpg)
One layer off, another to go.

![Furniture stuffing](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/first-look-stuffing.jpg)
At this point I got my first glimpse of what furniture stuffing had been used. Something similar to needled wool felt.

![Straws and hay as well](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/straws.jpg)
It was much more surprising to find hay beneath the needled wool felt. Apparently, it is common to use straw as a base layer in furniture filling. I had no idea!

In the end I decided to replace the needled wool felt, since it smelled somewhat old. The straw, however, I decided to keep just because it looked very hard to remove. And it didn't smell all that much, either.

![Details from under fabric](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/details-under-fabric.jpg)
Took a picture here to remember to staple around the hole where the bolts go.

![Removing under fabric 4](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/under-fabric-pad-remove-4.jpg)

As you can see in the pictures above, pulling out all those staples left a lot of small holes in the wood frame. I ended up applying some wood glue to fill them up. Not sure if that was necessary.

## Cutting foam and attaching cotton batting
Unfortunately, from this point forward I became a bit carried away, and did not take as many photographs as I should. Hopefully, there are enough to show how the new upholstery was added.

**Use previous furniture filling or fabric as template**, and adjust from there.

![ Putting batting on the back support](/assets/2018/reupholstering-a-retro-armchair-diy/batting-back-support.jpg)
I pull firmly on the batting before stapling, starting from the center of each side, and work myself towards the end. It is a good idea to ask someone to hold the batting in place on one side, when you staple the other side.

## Cutting fabric with template
Basically repeat what you did with the cotton batting, but with even more accuracy.
