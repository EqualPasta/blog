Hello, and welcome to this blog. I'll mostly be posting about things that interest me, in areas
related to software development, but also not exclusively so.

As for me, I'm a dude from Norway, and have recently graduated and is now working full time at a company as a software developer. In my spare time, of which I can spare, I try invest some time in fun hobby project. Which I guess you'll be reading about here.

Below you can find some details about the blog:

* Made by the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) engine, a static site generator
* Design comes from a customized version of the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) template
* Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* Blog posts written in [Atom](https://atom.io/) with help from the [Markdown Writer](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer)

Anyways, thanks for reading!
