Hello, and welcome to this blog. I'll mostly be posting about things that interest me, in areas
related to software development, but also other things.

As for me, I'm a dude from Norway, and work as a software developer. In my spare time, I try to spend some time with fun hobby project which I guess you'll be reading about here.

Below you can find some details about the blog:

* Made by the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) engine, a static site generator
* Design comes from a customized version of the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) template
* Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Anyways, thanks for reading!
